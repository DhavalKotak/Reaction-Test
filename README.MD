### Introduction

So I made a web application in which you can measure your reaction time.

It is built using vanilla Javascript.

### The Game

You have 5 attempts. Click as soon as you can when you see the green screen.

At the end you will get your average reaction time.

To restart the test just click on the screen when the test ends.
